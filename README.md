# Robot Projects
This repository contains three exciting robot projects that you can explore and experiment with. Each project focuses on different aspects of robotics, ranging from basic movement to more advanced functionalities.

Project 1: Balancing Robot with PID Control
The Balancing Robot with PID Control project aims to build a robot that can maintain its balance on two wheels using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The project provides code examples, and resources to help you understand the principles of PID control and implement it in your robot.

Project 2: Motion Planning Delivery Robot with Computer Vision
The Motion Planning Delivery Robot with Computer Vision project combines computer vision and motion planning techniques to create an intelligent robot capable of navigating and delivering items in a dynamic environment. The project provides code samples, tutorials, and resources to guide you through the process of setting up the robot's camera, implementing object detection and tracking algorithms, and designing efficient motion planning strategies.

Project 3: Monkey Bar Climbing Robot
The Monkey Bar Climbing Robot project focuses on building a robot capable of traversing and climbing monkey bars. This project challenges you to design and build a robot that can navigate a set of monkey bars by gripping and swinging from one bar to another. The project provides code examples, mechanical designs, and resources to help you develop your climbing robot.
