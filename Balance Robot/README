We use a Hierarchical Task Network Planner for this assignment called litotane. https://github.com/domschrei/lilotane

It is required to install it to make my code work.

To generate the plan based on the init conditions, run in a terminal (it's automated, this is just for you to read the plan):
./lilotane Hanoi/domain.hddl Hanoi/pfile01.hddl -v=0 | cut -d' ' -f2- | sed 1,2d | head -n -2 > plan.txt

All file included in this .zip are to be added all together to the main folder.
